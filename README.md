## Architecture

We are using Nginx as the front end proxy for serving the website traffic, from the below two locations:

1. Docusaurus Documentation <https://wechaty.github.io/docusaurus/>
1. Jekyll Posts <https://wechaty.github.io/jekyll/>

## Nginx Configuration

1. for `/docs` locations, proxy pass to <https://wechaty.github.io/> with a prefix `docusaurus` added to the path.
1. for `/{news,blogs,contributors,\d\d\d\d}` locations, proxy pass to <https://wechaty.github.io/> with a prefix `jekyll` added to the path.

Learn more from [nginx.conf](nginx.conf) and [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) files.

That's all.
